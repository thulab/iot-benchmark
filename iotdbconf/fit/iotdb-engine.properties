# When a certain amount of insert ahead log is reached, it will be flushed to disk
# It is possible to lose at most flush_wal_threshold operations
flush_wal_threshold=10000

# The cycle when insert ahead log is periodically forced to be written to disk(in milliseconds)

### Directory Configuration
####################

# base dir
# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the IoTDB folder(i.e., %IOTDB_HOME%/data).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the IoTDB folder.
# Note: If sys_dir is assigned an empty string(i.e.,zero-size), it will be handled as a relative path.
# For windows platform
# If its prefix is a drive specifier followed by "\\", or if its prefix is "\\\\", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# base_dir=data
# For Linux platform
# If its prefix is "/", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# base_dir=data


# data dirs
# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the IoTDB folder(i.e., %IOTDB_HOME%/data/data).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the IoTDB folder.
# Note: If data_dir is assigned an empty string(i.e.,zero-size), it will be handled as a relative path.
# For windows platform
# If its prefix is a drive specifier followed by "\\", or if its prefix is "\\\\", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.
# data_dirs=data\\data
# For Linux platform
# If its prefix is "/", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.

# mult_dir_strategy
# The strategy is used to choose a directory from tsfile_dir for the system to store a new tsfile.
# System provides three strategies to choose from, or user can create his own strategy by extending org.apache.iotdb.db.conf.directories.strategy.DirectoryStrategy.
# The info of the three strategies are as follows:
# 1. SequenceStrategy: the system will choose the directory in sequence.
# 2. MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy: the system will choose the directory whose disk has the maximum space.
# 3. MinFolderOccupiedSpaceFirstStrategy: the system will choose the directory whose folder has the minimum occupied space.
# Set SequenceStrategy,MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy and MinFolderOccupiedSpaceFirstStrategy to apply the corresponding strategy.
# If this property is unset, system will use MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy as default strategy.
# For this property, fully-qualified class name (include package name) and simple class name are both acceptable.
# multi_dir_strategy=MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy


# wal dir
# If this property is unset, system will save the data in the default relative path directory under the IoTDB folder(i.e., %IOTDB_HOME%/data).
# If it is absolute, system will save the data in the exact location it points to.
# If it is relative, system will save the data in the relative path directory it indicates under the IoTDB folder.
# Note: If wal_dir is assigned an empty string(i.e.,zero-size), it will be handled as a relative path.
# For windows platform
# If its prefix is a drive specifier followed by "\\", or if its prefix is "\\\\", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.

# For Linux platform
# If its prefix is "/", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.

### Statistics Monitor configuration
####################

# Set enable_stat_monitor true(or false) to enable(or disable) the StatMonitor that stores statistics info periodically.
# back_loop_period_sec decides the period when StatMonitor writes statistics info into IoTDB.
# stat_monitor_detect_freq_sec decides when IoTDB detects statistics info out-of-date.
# IoTDB just keeps statistics info within stat_monitor_retain_interval_sec seconds before current time.
# Note: IoTDB requires stat_monitor_detect_freq_sec >= 600s and stat_monitor_retain_interval_sec >= 600s.

#    Setting the parameter to true, which has a greater impact on the insert performance of the IoTDB system and occupies less CPU of the machine.
# 2. If the sync data accounts for less than 50% of the update of the historical data (compared with the latest timestamp of the local storage group data),then it is recommended to select strategy 2.
#    Setting the parameter to false, which has little impact on the insert performance of IoTDB system and takes up a large amount of CPU power.
